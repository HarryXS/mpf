   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to Mission Pinball Framework's API reference!
=====================================================

This is the module API for the Mission Pinball Framework, a Python-based
software framework for controlling real pinball machines via Multimorphic P-ROC/
P3-ROC or FAST Pinball hardware. Full instructions and end-user documentation
are available at https://missionpinball.com/docs.

The site you're on now is the programmer's reference, for people who want to
write Python code to interact with MPF directly rather than (or in addition to)
using MPF's configuration files.
